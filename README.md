## Instruction

**Create a simple todo list that has the following functionalities:**

- You can add a new item to the todo list (required)
- You can remove an item from the todo list (required)
- You can edit an item in the todo list (optional)

**Some further requirements:**

- the input field must be reset when the add button is clicked on
- prevent empty values from being added to the list
- the todo list must show the most recently added item first on the list
- the todo list should be stored using **localStorage** (see helpful resources below). So, when the page is reloaded, any item in the todo list will still be displayed on the web page.
